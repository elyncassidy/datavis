# COS30045 T01 Website

This website was created as part of Exercise T01(a) for COS30045. It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript and is deployed on Vercel.

## Use of Github Copilot

I used Github Copilot to assist me while building this project.
Some examples of how i used it.
- fixed the footer not extending when more words were added by chaning height:100% to min-height:100%
- helped set up hover underline effects on navbar links with ::after
- showed how to make the website navigable with highlighted "active" page feedback in the navbar

## Reflection

Using Github Copilot was helpful for quickly generating code snippets and ideas. It saved me time when writing repetitive CSS.

However, I also noticed:
- Copilot sometimes suggested code that did not fit my project
- I had understand the code myself and adapt it, rather than copy blindly
- It was most useful for small tasks (hover effects, fixed footer) rather than big structural parts

Overall, Copilot was a useful tools, but I still needed to debug, test and make decisions myself. I learned that AI is a good asssistant, but not replacement for my own understanding of the code.
